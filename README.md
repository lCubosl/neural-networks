# neural-networks

Last project was a bust. Way out of my scope. The program could detect computer text,  signs, etc, but couldn't detect handwritting. <br />
I tried downloading an existing model, but couldn't implement it. I watched some tutorials and realized that I should probably take a step back. <br />

# the step back...
For the project to work and detect handwritting, I saw that a lot of people were using neural networks. I have heard a ton about it but I have no clue about how to implement them, so I should probably learn a little before I dip my toes again on the handwritting to text project.<br />
So this is my repository on neural networks. It contains my studies, stuff I find on the internet and my poor attempts at coding.
